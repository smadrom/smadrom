# Hi, I'm Pavel

I spent years as a PHP developer. Then I realized the language was never the point.

The point was knowing what to build, how to structure it, and why it should work that way. AI just removed the part where I had to remember semicolons.

### The shift

- ~~"I write PHP"~~ &rarr; I architect solutions, AI writes the code
- ~~One framework~~ &rarr; Whatever fits. Laravel, Go, Python, doesn't matter
- ~~Weeks per feature~~ &rarr; Ideas ship in hours

### What AI doesn't replace

Systems thinking. Knowing why your database will choke at 10k RPS. Understanding that "just add a cache" is not architecture. Years of debugging production at 3 AM taught me how systems actually work.

`Docker` `PostgreSQL` `Redis` `Ansible` `Claude Code` `AI Agents`

### Now

I design systems and let AI implement them. I build AI-powered dev workflows that make the whole process feel unreasonably fast. Most of my code is written by agents I orchestrate.

Turns out, the best use of a decade of engineering experience is telling AI exactly what to do.
